MACHINE LEARNING

recommender systems
  used to determine recommendations
  based on user or product comparisons
    distance metrics used to measure closeness
    recommendations are based on closeness of person and strength of recommendation

survival analysis
  probability of survival
    car engine
    human
    insurance policy
    churn
  need three fields
    column = probability of event (1/0)
    row = datetime (equidistant)
    color = groupings
  fit === learning from data

time series
  static data === independent observations
    y depends on coefficients and x's
    y = b0 + b1x + ...
  time-ordered data === dependent observations
    y depends on previous y
      can be confirmed using a lagplot (scatterplot of yt and yt-1)
    yt = b0 + b1 yt-1
    auto-regression
    non-systematic === random, error term
      cannot be modeled
    systematic === non-random
      things model takes into account when making predictions
      average (by time interval)
      seasonality
      trend (big-picture)
      noise (errors)
