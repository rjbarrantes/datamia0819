SQL

rows === records, entities
columns === fields, attributes
  hold specific information
e-r diagram === entity-relationship
  entities will have attributes
  entities represented by squares
  attributes represented by circles
    multi-value attributes === attributes that can have multiple values represented by double circle
    derived attributes === attributes that are derived from others (like age) represented by dotted circle
primary key === some unique, non-null id to differentiate records
  helps to reduce repititions across tables
foreign key === primary key on another table used to access that table's information
cardinality === way to describe relationships
  1:1 (ssn - customers)
  1:m (purchases - customers)
  n:m (products - customers)

queries
  CREATE DATABASE db;
    === create database db schema to populate
  USE db;
    === specify database db to run queries on
  CREATE TABLE x (
      y1 z1 NOT NULL UNIQUE AUTO_INCREMENT,
      y2 z2,
      PRIMARY KEY (y1),
      FOREIGN KEY (y2) REFERENCES db(tb)
  );
    === create table x with columns y1 (no nulls allowed and auto-incremented, primary key) and y2 (foreign key from database db table tb) with datatypes z1 and z2
      datatypes char/varchar like need to specify value in parentheses (VARCHAR(100))
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS db.tb;
    === deletes table tb completely
  ALTER TABLE db.tb
  MODIFY COLUMN x y;
    === alter table tb column x to datatype y
  ALTER TABLE db.tb
  DROP COLUMN x;
    === drop column x from table tb
  ALTER TABLE db.tb
  ADD COLUMN x y;
    === add column x from table tb
  ALTER TABLE db.tb
  AUTO_INCREMENT = 0;
    === re-start auto-incremented variable to 0
  CREATE TABLE db.tb
  SUBQUERY;
    === creates new table tb based on query
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE db.tb
  QUERY;
    === creates temporary table tb based on query
      data stored temporarily for session (data does not adjust with db)
      subqueries/derived tables are stored for the query (data adjusts with db)
  DELETE FROM db.tb
    === deletes values in table tb, but not table
  DELETE FROM db.tb
  WHERE x
    === deletes values in table tb under where condition x
  INSERT INTO db.tb
  SUBQUERY;
    === way to repopulate an emptied table
  UPDATE publications.store_sales_summary
  SET x = x + 5;
    === way to update values based on formula (can include where statement)
